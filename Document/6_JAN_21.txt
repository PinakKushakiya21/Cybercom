Today we have session of chirag sir and in that session sir discuss about the command of git.

-> git log-> list the version history for the current branch. 
-> git rivert-> forward-moving undo operation that offers a safe method of undoing changes. 
-> git rivert head-> remove the tree in the history. 
-> git stage-> combined every data in single place.  
-> git diff-> shows the file differences which are not yet staged.
-> git diff â€“staged-> shows the differences between the files in the staging area and the latest version present.
-> git reset-> unstages the file, but it preserves the file contents.
