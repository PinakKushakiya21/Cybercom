In today's lecture the topic I learned and understand are :

-> Function returning function : In this topic the similar to nested function is used in which one function 
				 is written inside another function and the output is send the final output 
				 to the screen.

-> IIFE : Immediately invoked function expression : Is used to invoked the function , In this what is 
						    inside the paranthesis cannot be statement, its a expression.

-> Closures : An inner function has always access to the variables & parameters of its outer function, 
	      even after the outer function has returned.

-> Bind , Call & Apply : Bind is allows "pre-set" some arguments.

-> Difference Between ES5 AND ES6.
-> How the written code in ES5 and how it become so easy in ES6.
