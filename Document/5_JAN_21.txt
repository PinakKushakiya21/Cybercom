Yesterday we have a task to create a repositary and run some command which given in documentation by Chirag sir.

So after yesterday meeting I completed that task and in that run some commands are :

-> $mkdir = to make the directory .
-> git clone = to cone that in the local desktop.
-> git fetch origin = to get updated result of our repo. 
-> git status = to check the file is up to date or not.
-> git add = to add a file in the repo.
-> git commit = to commit and with that we passed the message.
-> git push = to push the modified file in the repo.

-> When performing task i don't know how to exit the vim editor so that i resolve this to open the terminal ang go for the furthur process.
-> The editor is open when we not passed message during merge file.
-> Also Chirag sir cleared the some doubt about the git.
-> Also explain every doubt with proper example.

In today meeting we have a task to create a repository and cretae a 3 folder in that are :
1) Document : In this file we create a document of our everyday full work and upload in the end of the day.
2) Coding : If we practice some coding then upload a code file in this folder.
3) Practice : what we practice in the whole day for our personal purpose.
