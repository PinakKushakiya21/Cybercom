Today I Learned topics are :

-> Arrow function 

-> Arrow function lexical 'this' keyword : we declared this in any variable and call the
					   variable which we declared outside the function.
			-> The above statement is only work in ES5 not in ES6 because without stored this keyword in any 
			   variable we can call the variable which is outside the function.

-> Destrucuring : Actually I not get properly this concept so that I asked madam to elaborate.

-> Arrays : Stores many data of same datatype.
	    - In this also learn about the difference between for loop and foreach loop.
