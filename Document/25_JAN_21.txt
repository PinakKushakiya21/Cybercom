Today I learned basic concept of php again in that :

-> die and exit Functions : to terminate the funvtion
-> Expression Matching : to match the expression of any field.
-> Functions with Arguments: passing any argument as a variable in fuction.
33. Functions with a Return Value : returning some value buy function which is stored in some variable
 when we call that function
-> Global Variables and Functions : to access globally.
-> String Functions

The above I will practice and properly cleared the concept and also working on javascript program which
we perform on test in that i have some doubts so that i practice that after today's lectured completed.
